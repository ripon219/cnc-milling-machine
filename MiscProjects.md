To avoid creating a bunch of tiny meaningless projects, I've decided to create additional SVN subdirectories to house code related to some of my other electronics projects - mostly those created or enhanced using the milling machine.

Misc. Project list:

  * PIC-Gen - Function Generator/Frequency Counter based on EPE magazine article in July 2000.  For details, see my [blog entry](http://vinces-electronics.blogspot.com/2008/11/project-function-generator-and.html).  Housed in trunk/picgen in source control.
